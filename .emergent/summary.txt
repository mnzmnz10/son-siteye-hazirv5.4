The AI engineer successfully implemented several core features and performed extensive debugging. Initially, an authentication system with username/password login was added to both the FastAPI backend (with JWT and admin user creation) and React frontend. This involved significant CORS and React Hook state management debugging. Subsequently, product editing was enhanced to include brand and company fields, requiring frontend UI updates and backend model adjustments. The package creation/editing flow was refactored: description fields removed, UI changed to a two-column layout, and a collapsible supplies section added. This also necessitated fixing a  mismatch in the backend for supplies. Lastly, a manual category grouping system was introduced with CRUD endpoints and frontend management, along with package pricing, total calculation, and discount features, which also required React state initialization fixes and MongoDB  serialization handling in the backend.

<product_requirements>
The user requested several features and improvements for the application. Initially, a fundamental authentication system was required, enabling users to log in with a username and password. Specific credentials (, ) were provided. Following this, the ability to manually edit product brand and company names directly from the product listing was requested. The package management system needed significant improvements: removing the package description field, converting the Sarf Malzemesi Ekle section to be collapsible, and restructuring the package product addition UI into a two-column layout (added products on the left, add/remove on the right) to avoid showing the Sarf Malzemesi category in the main product selection. Additionally, the user wanted to see the total price of products in a package, a toggle discounted price feature (eye icon), and a discount percentage field for packages during creation and editing. Finally, a system to manually group categories (e.g., Akü, Güneş Paneli into Enerji Grubu) was requested, with these groups displayed in package and quote sections.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **FastAPI:** Python web framework for backend API.
- **React:** JavaScript library for frontend UI.
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** For authentication.
- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** Critical for frontend-backend communication.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For styling.
- **React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo):** For state management and lifecycle in React.
- **Pydantic:** Data validation for FastAPI models.
- **Environment Variables:** For configuration (e.g., , ).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack architecture:


- ****:
    - **Importance:** This is the core of the FastAPI backend, defining API endpoints, database models, and business logic.
    - **Changes:**
        - **Authentication:** Added , ,  Pydantic models. Implemented functions for password hashing/verification, JWT token creation, and current user retrieval. Added  and  endpoints. Included a startup event to create a default admin user.
        - **CORS:** Modified  configuration to explicitly allow  and dynamically set  based on the frontend URL.
        - **Product Update:** Modified  to include updating the  field.
        - **Package Models:** Added  to  and  models.
        - **Supplies Management:** Corrected  and  endpoints for package supplies to correctly identify supplies by  instead of an auto-generated uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root).
        - **Category Groups:** Added  model. Implemented  (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) endpoints. Ensured MongoDB  is converted to a string uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) for JSON serialization upon retrieval and creation.

- ****:
    - **Importance:** This is the main React component, managing the application's state and rendering the UI.
    - **Changes:**
        - **Authentication:** Added , ,  states. Implemented , ,  functions. Added conditional rendering to show a login page or the main app.
        - **Environment Variables:** Created  file for frontend to use .
        - **Product Editing:** Updated  state with  and . Modified , , . Added input fields for brand and a dropdown for company to the product edit form.
        - **Package Editing UI:** Removed  field from  state and package create/edit dialog. Refactored package editing layout to a two-column grid.
        - **Package Supplies:** Implemented  state and  function for a collapsible Sarf Malzemesi Ekle section. Filtered out Sarf Malzemeleri category from the product addition list using .
        - **Package Pricing/Discount:** Added  to  state. Implemented total price calculation with an eye icon toggle for discounted prices. Added discount input to package create/edit forms.
        - **Category Grouping:** Added , ,  states. Implemented CRUD functions (, , etc.) for category groups. Added UI for managing category groups. Included  in . Implemented  for product grouping.
        - **React Hooks:** Performed multiple refactorings of  hooks to ensure correct ordering and state initialization (e.g., ).

- ** & **:
    - **Importance:** Configuration files for environment variables.
    - **Changes:** Created these files and populated them with  (for backend) and  (for frontend).

<current_work>
The most recent work involved fixing an issue with category group creation. Users were reporting an eklediğimiz kategori özelliğinde hata var. kategorilerden seçip oluştur dediğimde kategori grubu oluşturulamadı yazıyor error. Upon investigation of backend logs, a  was observed for . The root cause was identified as a MongoDB  field serialization issue. MongoDB automatically adds an  field (an ObjectId) which is not directly JSON serializable. The AI engineer corrected the backend logic in  within the  endpoint to convert the MongoDB  to a string uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) before returning the newly created  object. A similar fix was also applied to the  endpoint to ensure consistency when retrieving existing category groups. After restarting the backend, these changes were tested via , confirming that category groups can now be successfully created and retrieved without internal server errors, providing a JSON-serializable uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) field.
