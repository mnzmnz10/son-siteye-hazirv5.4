<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully implemented a complex set of features and resolved critical bugs across the FastAPI backend and React frontend. Key achievements include a robust authentication system, enhanced product and package editing with pricing, discounts, and labor costs, and a comprehensive category/category-group management system featuring drag-and-drop sorting. Major debugging efforts were focused on MongoDB serialization issues, frontend state management, data structure mismatches in supplies, and / incompatibilities in PDF generation. The trajectory details a meticulous process of feature implementation, testing, user feedback integration, and iterative bug fixing, demonstrating a high level of problem-solving and adaptation to evolving requirements. The current focus has shifted to large-scale performance optimization, starting with backend pagination.

<product_requirements>
The application needed several features. Initially, a user authentication system (username/password: karavan_admin, corlukaravan.5959) and product editing for brand and company names were requested. Package management was enhanced to remove descriptions, offer a two-column UI, collapsible supplies, total price calculation with a discount percentage and toggleable discounted price view. A system for manual category grouping (e.g., Akü, Güneş Paneli into Enerji Grubu) was also added. Subsequent requests refined package editing to mirror a Quotes section, including detailed discount and labor cost displays, removal of extraneous UI elements, and renaming saving to profit. Users also requested drag-and-drop sorting for both categories and category groups, with this order consistently applied across product listings, package creation, and PDF exports. PDFs required reduced font sizes and correct display of category groups. Finally, a critical bug with saving package labor/discount was fixed, and these costs were integrated into PDF summaries. The current user request is for performance optimization, especially for product listings, to handle 2000-3000 products.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:


- ****:
    - **Importance:** Defines API endpoints, MongoDB models, and business logic.
    - **Changes:**
        - **Models**: Added  to  and . Added  to  and . Fixed  serialization for .
        - **Endpoints**: Implemented authentication (, ). Updated product update to include . Corrected supplies /. Added CRUD for . Added  and  for bulk sorting.
        - **PDF Generation**: Refactored PDF generation methods () to handle category grouping, dynamic pricing (discount, labor cost), and reduced font sizes. Critical async/sync issues with ReportLab and MongoDB calls were resolved by pre-fetching data synchronously.

- ****:
    - **Importance:** Manages application state, UI rendering, and frontend logic.
    - **Changes:**
        - **Authentication**: ,  states, login/logout handlers.
        - **Product Forms**: Updated  with , .
        - **Package UI**: Refactored package creation/editing to two-column, collapsible supplies, removed description. Implemented dynamic pricing summary (discount, labor cost, net total), including a toggleable eye icon. Removed old pricing/eye icon elements.
        - **State Management**: Introduced , ,  states. Refactored ,  to support new pricing.
        - **Category & Group Sorting**: Added ,  states and HTML5 drag-drop handlers for both categories and category groups. Integrated  into category/group displays across product lists, package editing, and dropdowns.
        - **Supplies Fix**: Corrected data structure in  to properly pass .
        - **Utility Functions**: Added , .

<current_work>
The AI engineer has successfully completed several complex features. The most recent completed task involved fixing two critical issues: 1) packages not updating when discount or labor cost was added, and 2) discount and labor costs not appearing in PDF downloads.
To address this,  was added to the  and  models in  (backend), and frontend functions like  and  in  were updated to correctly handle and persist this new field. For PDFs, the  in  was extended with a new method, , which now generates a detailed pricing summary including list price, discount, discounted total, labor cost, and net total, with appropriate styling. Both issues were thoroughly tested and verified as resolved.
Currently, the AI engineer is initiating a new task: comprehensive performance optimization, starting with backend improvements for product sections, particularly pagination, to support a large volume of products (2000-3000).
